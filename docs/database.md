### **Choosing NoSQL and DynamoDB for Video Data Storage**

The decision to use a **NoSQL database** was driven by the nature of our data model and the need for scalability, flexibility, and performance. Our service manages video records in a single **"videos"** table, where each entry contains attributes such as `id`, `userId`, `name`, `description`, `url`, `snapshotsUrl`, `status`, and timestamps. Since our data is self-contained and does not require complex relationships or joins, a relational database was unnecessary. A NoSQL approach allows us to store and retrieve data efficiently without the overhead of rigid schema constraints or costly join operations. Additionally, NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, making them ideal for handling high-throughput workloads.

Among the NoSQL options available, **Amazon DynamoDB** was chosen for its fully managed, high-performance, and serverless architecture. DynamoDB provides fast retrieval of video metadata, which is essential for our application's performance. It also **automatically scales** based on traffic, eliminating the need for manual capacity planning or infrastructure management. Unlike traditional databases, which require frequent tuning and indexing, DynamoDB offers built-in high availability and durability with seamless scalability. Given that our use case involves frequent read/write operations without complex queries, DynamoDB was the ideal choice for achieving simplicity, reliability, and efficiency in our video processing system.
